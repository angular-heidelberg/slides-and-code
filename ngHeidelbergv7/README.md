## CDK â€“ Toolbox for Angular

When developing enterprise apps with Angular, we need a rich set of UI components in order to be fast and efficient. But what happens if there is no ready-made component for a use case available? The "Component Dev Kit" (CDK) comes to the rescue. It simplifies the development of wizards, popups, drag & drop and other component behaviors.

In this talk, Christian will give an overview of the CDK followed by some live coding.
