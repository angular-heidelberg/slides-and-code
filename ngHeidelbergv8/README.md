## Michael Hladky: Angular and RxJS â€“ Tackling Component State Reactively

Ever heard about "ephemeral state"? Ngrx, ngxs, akita etc did a great job in managing global state in SPAs. However, nobody talked about the complexity and pain of managing the local component state. Based on a quote of "Gang of Four": "If you stick to the paradigms of OOP the design patterns appear naturally". I will solve isolates problems in a reactive way and the final design pattern for reactive component state results naturally.

If you attend this talk you will hear about:
- subscription-less components
- local state management
- handling local side-effects

You will be able to write fully reactive components that will be well structured and organised without any effort.
