## Web goes Native: Progressive Web Apps (PWA) with Angular

Buzzword Bingo time! For sure, PWA is one of the hottest topics in Web space today. Come and join Thinktectureâ€™s Christian Liebel to learn about how to design and build Progressive Web Apps with Angular. A PWA should feel like a real app we are used to since years, users want an icon on the home screen and native-like performance and functionality. To achieve this, we are going to touch several architectural and feature areas such as application shell, offline capabilities, push notifications and payment. And of course, we will see all of this in action with Angular CLI and accompanying tools. This is surely going to be a lot of fun, not just for mobile devices.
