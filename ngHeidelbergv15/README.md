Angular 13 will be released in a few days – let's celebrate this milestone! The Angular team is throwing a party and we are all invited! 🎉🎉🎉

We're going to watch the livestream together and we're super excited to see all the cool new updates that the 🅰️Angular team has prepared. Afterwards we stay around in the zoom meeting and continue the party. Expect some small talk and friendly discussions from your favourite German Meetup team and its great community. If you like, you can try out `ng update` right away. The ngHeidelberg team will be happy to help.
